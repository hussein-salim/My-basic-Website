# My-basic-Website

This project is a simple, multi-page website built purely with HTML.  The goal is to demonstrate a solid, semantic HTML structure without any CSS styling. This project is designed as a learning exercise to understand website structure, semantic HTML, and basic SEO principles before moving on to styling with CSS.

## Goals

As outlined in the roadmap.sh project, the goals of this project are:

*   Learn how to create multiple pages in a website.
*   Structure a website using HTML in a semantic way.
*   Structure in a way that you can easily add styles later.

## Key Features

This website includes the following pages and features:

*   **Projects Page (projects.html):**  Showcases a list of example projects.
*   **Articles Page (articles.html):**  Contains example articles related to web development.
*   **Contact Page (contact.html):**  Includes a contact form for user inquiries.
*   **Navigation Bar:**  A consistent navigation bar is present on all pages, linking to each of the main pages (Homepage, Projects, Articles, Contact).
*   **Semantic HTML Structure:**  The website is built using semantic HTML5 tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>` to properly structure the content.
*   **SEO Meta Tags:**  Each page includes relevant meta tags in the `<head>` section for basic Search Engine Optimization (SEO), such as:
